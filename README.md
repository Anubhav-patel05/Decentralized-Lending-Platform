# Decentralized Lending Platform

## Project Description

The Decentralized Lending Platform is a smart contract-based financial protocol built on Ethereum that enables users to participate in decentralized lending and borrowing without intermediaries. The platform allows users to deposit ETH as liquidity providers and borrow ETH against collateral, creating a trustless and transparent lending ecosystem.

This project implements core DeFi lending mechanics including over-collateralization, interest calculations, and automated liquidation safeguards. Users can earn interest on their deposits while borrowers can access liquidity by providing collateral worth 150% of their borrowed amount.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to democratize access to financial services by creating a decentralized, transparent, and accessible lending platform that operates without traditional banking intermediaries. We aim to:

- **Eliminate Traditional Barriers**: Remove geographical restrictions and credit checks that limit access to financial services
- **Ensure Transparency**: Provide complete visibility into all transactions and platform mechanics through blockchain technology
- **Enable Global Access**: Allow anyone with an internet connection and cryptocurrency to participate in lending and borrowing
- **Promote Financial Inclusion**: Create opportunities for underbanked populations to access credit and earn yield on their assets
- **Foster Innovation**: Serve as a foundation for more advanced DeFi protocols and financial instruments

## Getting Started

1. **Deploy the Contract**: Deploy `Project.sol` to your preferred Ethereum network
2. **Deposit Liquidity**: Call the `deposit()` function with ETH to provide liquidity
3. **Borrow Against Collateral**: Use the `borrow()` function with appropriate collateral
4. **Repay Loans**: Call `repay()` function to settle debt and retrieve collateral

## Technical Requirements

- Solidity ^0.8.19
- Ethereum-compatible blockchain network
- Web3-enabled wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
